# Purpose 
This repository contains the data and code for all analysis, for the paper "Integrating rare variant genetics and brain transcriptome data implicates novel schizophrenia putative risk genes".

# Data 

* newGenexp.RData, downloaded from [here](https://github.com/linnykos/covarianceSelection/blob/master/newGenexp.RData). 

# Running the annalysis

Below are the following steps to run the analysis. Codes are borrowed and modified from the paper [Covariance-Based Sample Selection for Heterogeneous Data: Applications to Gene Expression and Autism Risk Gene Detection](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1738234), with [codes](https://github.com/linnykos/covarianceSelection/tree/master).
